C4 is a blockchain-enabled web-app, similar to instagram. This project is currently in early development stages. 
The primary goal for this project is to create an art-sharing app, where followers could invest in early-stage art, games, and app creations as they progress by tipping/donating cryptocurrency to the creator. In return, the creator's micro-investing followers would be rewarded with a token, generated for each project.

Tech: MongoDB, Express, React, Socket.io, and Cloudinary for image hosting (image hosting via IPFS to be integrated in the future)
